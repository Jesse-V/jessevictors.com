				I mainly listen to only true music. There are only a small number of people in this world who can play true music, but those that do expertly wield a small number of instruments.  These artists include Howard Shore, (who composed and produced the soundtrack to The Lord of the Rings) as well as the PianoGuys, and Lindsey Stirling, who are both on YouTube.
