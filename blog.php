                  I'm excited to release a new design for my website! This is the culmination of a complete redesign and a rewrite from the ground up. It's a newer and more modern design, with more Javascript and less PHP, new features, new pages, more pictures, and easier navigation. It's the third design generation in my site's history, but one that can serve me well for years to come.

                  As the years progress, my interests grow and change. I want my website to be an accurate reflection of my life, skills, and interests. I'd like it to be interesting to my friends as well as anyone who's professionally interested in me. As time goes on, it becomes important to keep the content and the design up-to-date and modern. The time came for a new design, and I'm really happy with the result. The code for the site is on Github: <a href="https://github.com/Jesse-V/jessevictors.com">Jesse-V/jessevictors.com</a>.
