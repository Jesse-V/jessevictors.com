					About Me

				<div class="text">
					<p>
						My name is Jesse Victors. I'm 20 years old, and I hail from a log house in Big Lake, Alaska. Currently I'm a junior studying computer science at Utah State University.

						<!--Big Lake, etc

						My family, seen above, raised me in Big Lake, Alaska. My father and grandfather homesteaded out there in the 1960s, and over time the house grew to 1100 square feet. As is the case for most locations in Alaska, our house is located in a rural environment surrounded by miles of trees. A small friendly community of a dozen families surrounds us, and we live behind a locked gate. We have a large lawn, and a nearby creek that flows a dozen miles from Big Lake to the ocean. My parents raised me to be kind, see the good in people, have a clean mind, put work before play, and be inquisitive and observant. Their parenting philosophy is based on love, long term thinking, and logic. Throughout my entire life, I have never seen them get seriously angry, swear, hit, or shout.
						My family is LDS. We attend church on a regular basis. The Willow Ward of the LDS Church is about a 45 minute drive from our house. Here at Utah State University, I am in the 6th Ward, and I regularly attend church.-->

						<!--Computer Science, current interests, etc

						I enjoy computer science, as well as many other sciences in general. I find novel or state-of-the-art ideas particularly fascinating, even if they are very technical in nature. I like helping people, working in groups or independently, and watching historical documentaries. I am motivated to learn as much as I can and to carry high grades; I plan to achieve something great in this world. Some of my favorite recreational activities include camping, hiking, scuba diving, and archery. The TV that I watch consists primarily of either the History Channel, History International Channel, Military Channel, Whose Line is it Anyway?, and Star Trek the Next Generation. I enjoy action movies, and I think the Lord of the Rings trilogy is the greatest set of movies ever made. 

						Computer science is sometimes my entertainment. I enjoy problem solving, looking at a problem from many angles, and optimizing code. I’ve always got something I’m working on, so I’m constantly improving my skills. I believe that one has found the perfect recreational activity when they enjoy something that will benefit them later on.
						
						I enjoy video games such as Minecraft, World of Goo, the Portal series, Diablo 3, and a few strategy games. I have played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and I like much more than Black Ops, though enjoy much more than Halo. I mainly listen to only true music. There are only a small number of people in this world who can play true music, but those that do expertly wield a small number of instruments.  These artists include Howard Shore, (who composed and produced the soundtrack to The Lord of the Rings) as well as the PianoGuys, and Lindsey Stirling, who are both on YouTube.
						
						I like to surround myself with friends who are intelligent, clean, and cheerful. As I’ve demonstrated in the multiple games of Humans vs. Zombies we play at Utah State, I can hold my own against a horde of brain-starved zombies.

						<!--Folding@home

						I also have a great deal of interest in a scientific research project called Folding@home, which I joined in October 2010. This project revolves around thousands of people around the world running a small program on their computer, which does calculations for Stanford University to accelerate their disease research. Like most everyone participating in this project, I don’t know need to know any technical biochemistry knowledge, but all I have to do is run their program on my computer. It performs simulations of proteins and other molecules changing shape in the body, because if things go wrong there then horrible diseases like Alzheimer’s, cancer, or Parkinson’s may occur. It doesn’t even interfere with my regular computer usage, and its nice knowing that I can power state-of-the-art research without having to spend any money. Scientists have produced more than 95 scientific papers as a result of Folding@home with much of the promising results open to the public, and it is arguably the most powerful computing system on the planet today. I’ve led the “USU Aggies” team high into the rankings, and overall we’ve contributed an astonishing amount of computing to the project. I really feel that our contributions have significantly helped Folding@home, and I know they are being put to good use.
						
						As my interest in the project grew, so did the level of my involvement. Starting from a pretty dismal state, I wrote nearly the entirety of the 6,900-word Folding@home article on Wikipedia and achieved its Good Article status in April 2012, which meant that other editors recognized it as pretty encyclopedic and well-written, although further tweaks could still be made before it could be considered top-notch. The article is read between 400 and 500 times per day. I’m active on the Folding@home support forum, and my feedback has even been quoted by the director of the project, Dr. Pande from Stanford University, in one of his blog posts. When a scientists begins studying an interesting protein, I’m one of several dozen volunteers who test the stability of newly-minted simulation units when they are first released outside of the research lab. Aside from actually working at Stanford itself, I consider this to be as close to the front lines of disease research as I could get. I’ve also been granted permission to edit the FAQ pages of the project’s official website, which is typically exclusively edited by mods, admins, and research scientists.
						
						Alzheimer’s, cancer, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, Huntington's disease, and viral infection have killed millions in the past. Cancer in particular can devastate and kill a young child before they’ve had a chance to fully enjoy life. I know of no other project where anyone can help power state-of-the-art research towards the root causes of these diseases without donating any money, while being kept up-to-date of where the efforts are going and the progress the project is making towards cures.-->
