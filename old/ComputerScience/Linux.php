					What is Linux? Linux is a class of operating systems; there are three main types of OSs for desktops: Microsoft Windows, Mac OS-X, and Linux. An operating system is a vival component to a computer, as it works in between programs and computer hardware. The choice of an OS matters because each is designed to operate differently. If multiple programs are running at the same time (as they usually are) and are asking for system resources like memory, CPU time, or access to the hard drive, how does it manage responding to those requests? How can the user interact with the computer? How can it quickly respond to user input? How are the files in the hard drive organized? How flexible and adjustable is the software? How is the computer secured against unauthorized or malicious actions? Does the user have access to the computer code that runs the operating system, and if so can they change it? An operating system has to provide solutions to all of these questions.

					Linux is the only class of operating systems that lets me use my computer however I want. I have complete flexibility over the control and functionality of my computer. I feel that this is how computers ought to work, and I'd go so far to say that it's my fundamental right. I want my computer to do a lot of things for me, but I still want to be able to adjust what it does if I so choose. Linux was designed with this in mind, and it's a completely free and open. There's a small amount of flexibility in Windows and OS-X, but not nearly as much as in Linux. I also want to be able to trust the stability, functionality, and security of my computer, and usually that involves having faith that Apple or Microsoft know what they're doing. I don't like this. I want to be able to confirm things for myself if I so choose, and I can do that thanks to the freedom of open-source software. This is why in the fall of 2012 I switched from Microsoft Windows in Linux Mint.

					I found a fantastic article titled "10 fundamental differences between Linux and Windows". It's very informative, and I recommend you check it out: <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10things/10-fundamental-differences-between-linux-and-windows/406">article on TechRepublic.com</a>

					I think many people consider Linux to be really technical, and they aren't interested because they are happy with their setup in Windows or OS-X. This is unfortunate, and I wish people would do some research and educate themselves a bit more. I like being informed when I made a decision, and my choice of operating systems is no different. I don't have the time or desire to custom-compile stuff in the command-line; I like to click on things just like most people do. I can do this in Linux Mint, which is really nice.

					There are many different "distributions" of Linux. Ubuntu, Mint, Redhat, and Fedora are but a few. Each distribution is still Linux and have a lot in common, but they each approach problems a bit differently. For example, some focus their software to be on the cutting-edge at the risk of instability, others are more conservative and use software that is throughly tested and very stable. Linux Mint takes this latter approach, which I appreciate. There are some pretty cool websites out there for helping newcomers choose a distribution that's right for them. I've used <a href="http://www.zegeniestudios.net/ldc/index.php?lang=en">the one on ZegenieStudios.net</a> as well as <a href="http://www.linux-chooser.com/">linux-chooser.com</a> and they both recommend Linux Mint to me.

					Agreeing with <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/about.php">the reasons on LinuxMint.com</a>, I like Linux Mint because:
					<ul>
						<li>
							It's is designed to be a modern, elegant and comfortable operating system which is both powerful and easy to use.
						</li>
						<li>
							It's is now the 4th most widely used home operating system behind Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS and Canonical's Ubuntu. This means that there is a wide user base and a significant level of community support.
						</li>
						<li>
							It works out of the box, with full multimedia support and is extremely easy to use.
						</li>
						<li>
							It's both free of cost and open source. I can donate to the team to support them if I want.
						</li>
						<li>
							It's community-driven. Users are encouraged to send feedback to the project so that their ideas can be used to improve Linux Mint. Brilliant, right!
						</li>
						<li>
							Multiple desktops to choose from. Windows forces you to use a particular set of buttons, colors, and menus indicative to that version of Windows. Windows XP's look and controls are much different than Window 7's. If I don't like Mint's default controls, I can switch to a different "desktop". Cinnamon, KDE, MATE, and Xfce are some of the most common desktops to choose from.
						<li>
							Linux Mint has one of the best software managers, and it maintains a list of over 41,000 software packages. I can choose a program from this list and install it without even going to the Internet. This is a <b>huge</b> security improvement over download software from sketchy websites that you have trust. Linux Mint's package list is based on Debian and Ubuntu, so there's a lot of compatibility too.
						</li>
						<li>
							It's safe and reliable. Thanks to a conservative approach to software updates, a unique Update Manager and the robustness of its Linux architecture, Linux Mint is secure and requires very little maintenance (no regressions, no antivirus, no anti-spyware... etc). Wouldn't it be nice if you could update everything in one place? It's called the Update Manager.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Linux Mint is just brilliant in so many ways. When my computer boots up, I get this feeling of freedom, security, brilliance, and control that I don't feel anywhere else. I'm intrigued enough to keep digging into the technical details of how it works, and it's so cool that I don't have to worry about tiptoeing around the legalities of proprietary software. It's all open source and brilliant! :)
