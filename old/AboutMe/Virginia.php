				 This page is dedicated to my sister. She is, and will continue to always be, the coolest girl on the planet. She had more love and more joy than anyone else that I know. She lived with me for over 12 wonderful years, but now she is living with our Heavenly Father. I was privileged to have her as my sister here on earth. Right after she was diagnosed with cancer, we were sealed in the Anchorage temple together as a family, so I know that she will never be lost from me. In early 2008, she was diagnosed with a thymoma, which is a really rare cancer. The hospital sent her to Seattle Children’s Hospital on a Lear Jet. She spent five months there. After they ran out of options we went to Houston, Texas for some alternative treatment. Later, she continued using their drugs back home to Alaska.

It was always her dream to own horses and she ended up having three.

				There were times that she was hurting, and times that she was sick, but she never felt sorry for herself. Throughout the two year struggle, she never gave up. I find it interesting that a missionary calling is two years long, and she fought cancer for almost exactly two years. Therefore, I am inclined to think that the purpose behind this entire thing was to teach as many people as she could some very important lessons. She taught so many different people about all the good things, not only from the Church, but from how people should be treating each other. Throughout her battle with cancer, she maintained that attitude of count your blessings, and above all, if you have the chance to show your love to someone, show it to them right now, because you never know if you won’t have the chance to show it to them later. Her attitude and her struggle affected hundreds of people, perhaps thousands.

           During Christmas of 2009, she wrote this sweet letter to Santa Claus, in which she asked only for a few things, including the curing of her cancer. She demonstrated her selfless attitude with requests such as “please help all the kids in the world who won’t have a merry Christmas … Could you bring what kids want, to all the children in the hospital for me?” She also dedicated about half her letter to wishing unicorns a merry Christmas, and “if I can’t see one, can I have a tailhair from one to make a bracelet out of?” She finished with “Please wish merry Christmas to Mrs. Claus, your elves, and all the other children in the world, including yours if you have any.” This letter to Santa was exceptionally sweet and innocent because she was twelve and a half years old. A letter like that demonstrates how special and unique she really was.

           I cannot recall ever having a fight with my sister. How can one even comprehend fighting with a girl as Christ-like and sweet as Virginia? Whatever her request or need, I always did my best to accomplish it. Despite my heavy school load and the challenge of keeping my grades with As or Bs, I continued to be a part of her care and treatment. This has taught me to not only be independent and self-motivated with my work, but also that some problems are not as large of a problem as they may seem. There are always worse things that can happen, and whatever the circumstances, to always remember to count your blessings, love others, and deal the issue as best as one can.

           Early in January of 2010, she passed away in her sleep. She is now with her Heavenly Father, and she no longer has cancer. We were sealed together as a family, so I know I will see her again. I am greatly looking forward to reuniting with her, so we can be a complete family once more.
