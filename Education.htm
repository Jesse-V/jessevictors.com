						In May of 2010, I graduated from Wasilla High School, located in Wasilla, Alaska. After scoring 1880 on my SAT and 28 on my ACT, I applied and was accepted to several universities, including University of Utah, BYU Provo, BYU Idaho, DeVry University in Seattle, and Utah State University. My cousins currently attend BYU, but their reports of the size of the campus and of Provo made me reconsider my desire to attend. DeVry has an interesting and attractive schedule system, but they simply didn't have what I was looking for. University of Utah is located in Salt Lake City: a place too big for someone like me from rural Alaska! Logan seemed the perfect size, and I decided that Utah State was the place for me. I also received several scholarships, so of course that was part of my decision as well.

						The Spectrum at Utah State University is one of the loudest arenas in the nation. Dedicated Aggie basketball fans pack the stands and to keep the nation's longest home winning streak alive.

						I first arrived at USU in August of 2010. My family and I drove 2,902 miles over the course of six days, and it was soon very clear that his was the right place for me. A medium-sized campus, Utah State is located near Logan Canyon, and has many mountains nearby. Its prominent religion is LDS, and is one of the top 40 Computer Science universities in the country. Although I'm far from my home in Alaska, I'm all right and I'm very happy being independent here.
					</p>
					<p>
						From the AP credits I obtained in high school, and the 16 credits I've normally been taking here, I'm almost a year ahead. I'll be entering my third year at USU. My declared major is Computer Science, with a Communications minor because effectively communicating ideas to a group or team is extremely important. I'm now focusing on taking care of the remaining advanced CS requirements, which include some high-level math courses as well.
					</p>

		   				Of course, the high-quality education isn't the only thing that Utah State offers, and it's not the only thing that I focus on. We happen to have an excellent basketball team. Thanks to our coach Stew Morrill, the USU Aggies win at home around 93% of the time. However, I believe that the team isn't the only reason we do well; the very environment inside the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum seems to have a major detrimental influence on the visiting team. Attending a game there is an experience unlike any other. This epic video accurately captures what goes on in the Spectrum; almost all of the events shown take place in every game. We are constantly screaming, chanting, and generally being downright ruthless. We do the craziest things to distract the other team, especially during free-throws! Any fans of the other team simply pale in comparison. The Spectrum holds over 10,000 people, and it is really something to see the them do our famous The Scotsman song! Several times throughout the video you can see the entire stadium doing the song with all of its accompanying arm motions in sync. This is just one of the many gameday rituals that all USU students perform in the Spectrum.

		   				Utah State has the perfect population. There are enough students to create many different clubs, groups, and a wide variety of elective classes,  but small enough that I don't feel too crowded and I have a high chance of running into someone I know. Everyone is so energetic, friendly, and intelligent. Each person has their own set of goals and visions that they are passionately striving to accomplish. I have discovered that I often have more in common with the other students here than I initially thought, but many times it is interesting to see their different lifestyle. There is also quite a diversity of homelands: California, Florida, England, Idaho, Utah, Maine, Armenia, China, and there's even several others from Alaska!
		   			</p>
		   			<p>
		   				Another thing that has impressed me is the incorporation of online material. All of my classes this last semester placed notes, lecture recordings, files, announcements, grades, study group meetings, and other information in one central location. This makes it extremely easy to quickly access important information and to stay on top of assignments, while still keeping things organized. Super high speed Internet is wired into every dorm, and the entire campus is a single Wi-Fi hotspot. Exam scores are emailed to each student and posted online shortly after they're finished. You can even see a histogram that shows statistics on how the class did overall. Some classes require students to purchase an iClicker: a small handheld personal voting machine, so that instructors can post questions mid-lecture to see if the class understands the information. It seems as if they have given me every advantage that I need to succeed; the only thing that can stop me from acing the material is my drive to study it.

						I've maintained a 3.67 GPA. There are many non-CS classes which I thoroughly enjoyed taking, and I've been enlightened in so many ways, both inside the classroom and out. Check out my Personal page to hear about one of my pursuits that's been a particularly educational hobby of mine.

						In general, college kids lack food and money. I have the food pretty much taken care of. We have two all-you-can-eat cafeterias: the Junction and the Marketplace. But they don't provide everything. Nothing makes a college kid like me happier than to receive packages, especially if it has scrumptious treats inside. If you need something to do, bake me some cookies, and then send them to me! :)
