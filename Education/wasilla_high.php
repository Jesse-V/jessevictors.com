						In May of 2010, I graduated from Wasilla High School, located in Wasilla, Alaska. After scoring 1880 on my SAT and 28 on my ACT, I applied and was accepted to several universities, including University of Utah, BYU Provo, BYU Idaho, DeVry University in Seattle, and Utah State University. My cousins currently attend BYU, but their reports of the size of the campus and of Provo made me reconsider my desire to attend. DeVry has an interesting and attractive schedule system, but they simply didn't have what I was looking for. University of Utah is located in Salt Lake City: a place too big for someone like me from rural Alaska! Logan seemed the perfect size, and I decided that Utah State was the place for me. I also received several scholarships, so of course that was part of my decision as well.
