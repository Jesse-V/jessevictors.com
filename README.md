Hand-crafted combination of HTML5, CSS3, and PHP5. Right now my website (www.jessevictors.com) is generated using MS-Publisher, and it looks derpy and the code is a mess. This project will eventually be deployed as a replacement, but since I'm still working on it, the code is uploaded under a sub-directory: www.jessevictors.com/new_website/
