jessevictors.com
================

A hand-crafted combination of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, PHP5, and MySQL.

Right now my website (www.jessevictors.com) is generated using MS-Publisher, but it looks derpy and the code is a mess.
This project will eventually be deployed as a replacement, but since I'm still working on it, the code is uploaded under a sub-directory: www.jessevictors.com/new_website/
