					I know a number of different programming languages, some at the application level such as Java, C++, and MIPS assembly, and others designed more for the web, like HTML5, CSS3, <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a>, Javascript, and PHP. I've worked with Javascript technologies like <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a>, <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a>, and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>. Each language has a purpose, and when used together the product is really amazing. A number of times I'll run across a problem and realize that I could write a program to solve it for me faster than I could solve the problem directly myself. Sudoku is an example. Half an hour later, and my recursive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking_algorithm">backtracking algorithm</a> can solve the puzzle in general. :) Obviously, some puzzles are more fun to solve by hand, such as the Rubik's Cube.

					List of programs coming soon! In the meantime, check out my <a href="https://github.com/JesseVictors?tab=activity">programming activity on Github</a>. Here are several software projects I'm particuly proud of: <a href="https://github.com/SpeedyShopOne/SpeedyShop">SpeedyShop</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JesseVictors/Victory-Paint">Victory Paint</a>, and a <a href="https://github.com/JesseVictors/Mandelbrot-Fractal">renderer for the Mandelbrot fractal</a>.
