      Reddit was one of the main communities that voted en-mass for a newly discovered humpback whale to be named "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Splashy_Pants">Mr. Splash Pants</a>". I think the light-heartedness of the logo reflects the Reddit community quite accurately.

         In my spare time, I'm very grateful that I have the opportunity to enjoy the Alaskan woods around the house. My family runs <a href="https://www.alaskawildflowerhoney.com/">Alaska Wildflower Honey</a>, one of the largest beekeeping operations in the state of Alaska, and this occupies some of my time during the summer. We also can escape and take our boat down to Seldovia, Alaska, a small and remote town in the southern end of the Kenai Peninsula.
      </p>

         When I'm not outside, I usually spend my spare time browsing around the Internet. I hang out on IRC, check in on forums, and follow Linux or security news blogs. Sometimes I turn on the television and watch Top Gear on BBCA, military documentaries, or other interesting shows. I watch shows on Netflix, or I read a book series.

         I'm fortunate to live in a beautiful area of Alaska. My family's log house, built by hand in the 60s, is surrounded for miles in all direction. It's twenty feet from a large creek that slowly flows from a nearby lake to the ocean. We've thinned out the trees around our house so we have a large lawn, but the house is still very tucked away amongst the trees. I enjoy being outside and I really appreciate our surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
         During the spring my family imports thousands of pounds of honeybees and beekeeping supplies for distribution to the beekeepers in South-central Alaska. My dad runs hives of his own, but we're the largest supplier of honeybees and beekeeping supplies in the state of Alaska. Beekeeping is challenging in Alaska due to the shorter flowering season, but like everywhere else it starts in the spring. Distributing out all the honeybees is quite a craziness in the springtime.
      </p>
      <p>
         During the summer, everything is fully thawed and the temperature usually reaches the high 70s or low 80s. It becomes a great time to go fishing or go on hikes. I'm usually away from school for the summer, so I get to enjoy this part of the year. assist my parents with the beekeeping business and help with the beehives. When I was younger I swam in the creek from time to time, but now I maintain our lawn and work on the footbridge that we use to cross the creek and follow the trail to my grandparent's house.

         During the fall, things start cooling down. Although I'm usually gone for school during the fall, at the end of the flowering season the family steals the honey from the bees (an activity the bees really don't like) and processes it. The wintertime is long and cold, although I enjoy coming back for Christmas break.

         In my spare time, I enjoy watching BBC America, the Military Channel, or Netflix. War documentaries and Top Gear are among my favorite shows on television. On Netflix I've watched medical dramas, medieval movies, action adventures, and other popular shows. Movie-wise, I think the Lord of the Rings is one of the greatest films ever made. I enjoyed the books, including the Hobbit, but I was disappointed by its film adaptation.
      </p>
      <p>
         On television or on film, I enjoy sometimes focusing on the details of the production: the costumes, the cinematography, the details in the background, and the soundtrack. In this the Lord of the Rings excels, but other films do well in too. For particularly good soundtracks, I find them on YouTube and listen to them through my studio-quality headphones. I'm a casual audiophile hobbyist, and I have really come to appreciate the quality of well-delivered sound.

         Several times during the summer the family and I take a trip down to Seldovia, Alaska. It's a small town of about 300 people, and it's only accessible by plane or by boat. We built a house across the bay from town, and although it's off the electrical grid and has no running water, it's quite a pleasant place to stay. The surrounding ocean and incoming tide into the lagoon provide good opportunities for fishing, although we often just like to relax and enjoy the view. We also have a nice boat that we take out on the water whenever we like.
      </p>
      <p>
         Seldovia, and I think our house and nearly family cabins in particular, are a great example of Alaskan independence. City-folk probably wouldn't understand why we would want to vacation in a house that has no running water, doesn't have television, and has little Internet to speak of, but we do enjoy the change. Our electricity comes from a large array of solar panels, we boil rain-water for cooking, and get our drinking water from across town. It's really nice to change from the modern commodities, get away from everything, and enjoy the surroundings.

         When I'm not outside or watching something, I often end up on Reddit my spare time. I've really come to love this site, and I don't regret leaving Facebook for it. I love the community, the whitty comments, and the gifs people post. I think this part of its Wikipedia article sums it up nicely:
