					Welcome to my website! Here you can find all sorts of information about me, my interests, my background, and my skills. I've also provided some photos that I find interesting. I believe that having a unique online presence is becoming more and more important, especially for someone in the computer science industry. Thus, as a demonstration of my web skills, I have coded this website by hand without the use of any drag-and-drop <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> (What You See Is What You Get) software. As an avid fan and user of free and open-source software, all the code behind this website is on <a href="https://github.com/Jesse-V/jessevictors.com">github.com</a>: arguably the most brilliant and useful service ever created for software repositories.

				<p>
					Feel free to explore and enjoy my website, and once again, welcome!
