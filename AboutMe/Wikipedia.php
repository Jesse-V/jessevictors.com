					Sometimes in my free time I log on to Wikipedia. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> is Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) and has an immersive gameworld with over 18.1 million <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedians">players</a> and over 4.13 million <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_is_an_article%3F">unique locations</a>, including 174,000 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Orphaned_articles">undiscovered secret areas</a>, 16,400 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Good_articles">completely explored dungeons</a> and 3,800 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_articles">boss levels</a>. Magical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Images">items</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categorization">powers</a> can be found scattered over these locations, whose navigation is aided by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Portal">maps</a> of the game world. Some of these locations, as well as items and powers, become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Encyclopedic">problematic</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Systemic_bias">unbalance</a> the game world. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedians">Players</a> will generally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy">dislike</a> these, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators">Game Masters</a> respond by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_process">destroying</a> them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Every <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_is_an_article%3F">unique location</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">gameworld</a> has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Talk_pages">tavern</a> where players have the opportunity to interact with any other player in real time. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedians">Players</a> often become friends with other players, and some have even arranged to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup">meet in real life</a>. Players may even build their own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:User_pages">houses</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Using_talk_pages">receive messages</a> from other players. On the darker side, some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedians">players</a> become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipediholic">addicted</a>, unable to leave the game, and spend all their waking hours on the site. It is often the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits">most experienced players</a> who end up spending the most amount of time in the gameworld.
				</p>
				<p>
					Players can accumulate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_count">experience points</a>, allowing them to advance to higher <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits">levels</a>. Players develop a unique distribution of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tools#Edit_counters">stats</a>, and can choose between a number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:User_access_levels">classes</a>, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Rollback_feature">Gunner</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:REVIEWING">Trickster</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee">Arch Mage</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:EFM">Sorcerer</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Oversight">Archer</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation_Committee">Priest</a>, as well as choosing from one of several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Wikipedia_fauna">races</a>, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_gnome">gnomes</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiOgre">ogres</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiImp">imps</a>. In some cases, a player may choose to play with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sock_puppetry">excessive summons</a>, or play with multiple warriors at the same time. This provides an additional challenge, because they must avoid being caught by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:CheckUser">Bounty Hunters</a>, who are tasked with rooting them out and destroying them. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedians">Players</a> can take on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject">quests</a>, fight <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates">boss battles</a>, enter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_discussions">battle arenas</a>, and even take <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship">class change trials</a> to become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators">Game Masters</a>. It is possible to stumble upon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion">random encounters</a> and defeat such <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAT:CSD">monsters</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="//meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/What_is_a_troll%3F">Trolls</a> are one of the most common enemies in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia">gameworld</a>, and often turn up in boss fights. Orcs, the natural enemies of the Trolls, who oppose trolls using methods which are equally unethical or destructive (such as <a href="//meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/What_is_a_troll%3F#Not_feeding_the_trolls">baiting</a>) can also be fought.  In combat, weapons such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Reverting">guns</a> are used normally, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Twinkle">cannons</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Huggle">swords</a> can be used to defeat an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Long-term_abuse">undefeatable enemy</a>. Many players also carry a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Protection_policy">shield</a> to protect themselves. Often, players will <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Watchlist">monitor</a> dungeons that they are (or have been) involved with with special cameras, which are connected to a private area which belongs to that player and that only he or she can access, and then only when logged in, so that enemies cannot use it to their advantage.
				</p>
				<p>
					Guns can be used in places other than battle arenas for clearing the problems of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_is_an_article%3F">dungeon</a>, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring">excessive use</a> of guns will probably be censured by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee">Imperial Court of Justice</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Cleaning_up_vandalism">Barbarian-fighting</a> is a form of combat that has many similarities to a variation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camping_(video_gaming)#Spawn">spawn kill</a>. Illegitimate battle strategies are abundant. Sneaky players like to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sock_puppetry">excessive summons</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bots">minions</a> to trick <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators">Game Masters</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Players can also attempt to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Do_not_disrupt_Wikipedia_to_illustrate_a_point">destroy</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism">mangle</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring">disrupt</a> parts of the game world. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_do_not_bite_the_newcomers">Player-killing</a> is strongly discouraged, but nevertheless happens. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Introduction">New players</a> are most vulnerable. Game Masters attempt to control this by placing offending players in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Blocking_policy">ice blocks, freeze locks</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:BAN">bans</a>, but more often than not, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_banned_users">criminals</a> end up being brought before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee">Super Game Masters</a>, who have the final say in dealing with them.

					Some Wikipedia players who successfully complete a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship">class change trial</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Successful_requests_for_adminship">manage</a> to become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators">Game Masters</a>, a secretive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Words_of_wisdom#On_Wikipedia_and_the_Cabal">clan</a> whose members have access to additional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators/Tools">spells</a> and items such as:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Deletion_policy">Cave-in</a> – a powerful spell which causes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Main_namespace">dungeon</a>'s walls to collapse, making it inaccessible to all but the most experienced adventurers (game masters and bounty hunters).
					</li>
					<li>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Undelete">Mining Toolkit</a> – a number of mining tools such as a mining helmet and wooden support beams which enable Game Masters to explore collapsed dungeons and re-open them to others if they want.
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ListGroupRights">Nuke</a> - explodes to collapse all dungeons of a player.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Blocking_policy">Ice Block</a> – encases another <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedians">player</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bots">minion</a> in a block of ice, preventing them from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page">moving</a> for a certain length of time (or forever!). A similar version is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Blocking_IP_addresses">Freeze Lock</a>, which locks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">gates</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Rangeblock">entire borders of gates</a> from entry. Whether the frozen player can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:User_talk_pages">speak</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Email">use hand gestures</a> or not is up to the game master in either case. Any gate next to a player in an ice block <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Autoblock">automatically freeze locks</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ListGroupRights">Thaw</a> – thaws a frozen player or minion out. A similar item is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IP_block_exemption">Sandwich-warming glove</a>, which is a wearable item that allows Game Masters and players permitted by Game Masters to enter through any gate, whether locked or not.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Protection_policy">Magic Chains</a> – seals the entrance to a dungeon with magical chains which can only be bypassed with special items. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:REDLOCK">Some dungeons'</a> magic chains are absolutely permanent and can never be removed, although the special items still allow a player carrying them to bypass them.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ListGroupRights">Skeleton Key</a> – a magical key given to all Game Masters which can remove any magical chains around a dungeon entrance for that player.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Patrolled_edit">Cloak of Silence</a> – quietens a player's footsteps, enabling them to avoid <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:New_pages_patrol/patrolled_pages">patrols</a>. A more powerful version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Minor_edit">Boots of Stealth</a>, which can be worn by most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedians">players</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Rollback_feature">Rapid-Fire</a> – can massively subdue multiple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism">attacks</a> at once. A more powerful version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Undo">Single-Fire</a>, which can be used by most players using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Page_history">guns</a>. Rapid-Fire <i>can</i> be utilized by normal players by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_rollback">becoming Gunners</a>, but only with the permission of Game Masters.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Import">Teleport</a> – can create an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Interwiki">inter-dimensional</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Portal">portal</a> that can summon a large number of dungeons.
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Revdelete">Brick dissolver</a>: Only game masters may use a brick dissolver, which allows <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_count">bricks</a> in a dungeon wall to be dissolved. A dissolved brick is nothing but a clear space that still supports the bricks above it, and can be only viewed by game masters or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Researchers">miners</a>. Whether the signature (edit summary) or even the name of the player who made the brick gets dissolved or not can be decided by the game master. The solvent is 69M per-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtainium">unobtanic acid</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						Brick crystallizer: A game master can also choose to re-crystallize a brick that has been dissolved, turning it back into a normally-functional brick.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					players can be promoted to Game Master (or demoted!) by even more powerful users known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bureaucrats">Overlords</a>, who, in addition to having the power to appoint new Game Masters and Overlords, can summon many powerful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bots">minions</a> to aid them in their adventuring.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jimbo_Wales">The Dark Lord</a>
					<br/>
					The master and founder of Wikipedia and its related worlds. He patrols the game world, and in former times he has had complete and total authority, and still is the only one besides the Knights who is allowed to change any user's user classes (including Knights). However, his power has been nerfed over recent years. Although he has become reluctant to use these powers, he still <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:ListUsers/Jimbo_Wales&amp;limit=1">has methods of overriding</a> the actions of Game Masters, and even Super Game Masters, by more subtle means. If you feel the game has treated you particularly unfairly, you can create free amusement for other players by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Jimbo_Wales">asking the Dark Lord for assistance</a>.
