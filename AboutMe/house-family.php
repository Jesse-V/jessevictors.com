					I hail from a unique and absolutely spectacular location. I live in a 1,100-square-foot log house in Big Lake, Alaska. A large creek flows about 20 feet from the house. My parents homesteaded out there in the 60s, and with the help of my grandparents and an Alaska native, cut down birch trees in the area and constructed the house. At that time, they were surrounded by trees for miles in all directions. 
				<p>
					In 1996 the Miller's Reach wildfire swept through the area, burning most of the area and leaving the remainder of the forest charred. Fortunately, my dad used the water from the creek to save the house and the nearby trees. We took the opportunity to greatly expand the lawn, but some of the best trees around still stand. Over time, the forest has partially restored, but it's still a very rural and natural area.

					We live with a dozen other families in a dirt road behind a locked gate. My dad runs the community road grader.

					In my family, we are calm, kind, clean, patient, and analytical. My parents hold to a philosophy based on love, long-term thinking, and logic. I'm very thankful to be raised to be inquisitive and observant. We are also LDS, and attend church on a regular basis. We were recently organized into a new ward, and the chapel is about a half an hour away. My dad is the ward clerk, and my mom is the president of the ward's Relief Society, so they are kept pretty busy with churchy activities.

					I enjoy computer science, as well as many other sciences in general. I find novel or state-of-the-art ideas particularly fascinating, even if they are very technical in nature. I like helping people, working in groups or independently, and watching historical documentaries. I am motivated to learn as much as I can and to carry high grades; I plan to achieve something great in this world. Some of my favorite recreational activities include camping, hiking, and scuba diving. The TV that I watch consists primarily of either the History Channel, History International Channel, Military Channel, Whose Line is it Anyway?, and Star Trek the Next Generation. I enjoy action movies, and I think the Lord of the Rings trilogy is the greatest set of movies ever made.

					I like to surround myself with friends who are intelligent, clean, and cheerful. I don't play a lot of video games because I often spend my time elsewhere. That said, I thoroughly enjoy unusual and creative games like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmB9b5njVbA">Minecraft</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A_JfkzPwww">World of Goo</a>, the Portal series, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pUhraVG7Ow">Assassin's Creed 3</a>. I've played Call of Duty and Halo a few times, and those are a lot of fun.
