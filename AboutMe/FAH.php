						I also have a great deal of interest in a scientific research project called Folding@home, which I joined in October 2010. This project revolves around thousands of people around the world running a small program on their computer, which does calculations for Stanford University to accelerate their disease research. Like most everyone participating in this project, I don’t know need to know any technical biochemistry knowledge, but all I have to do is run their program on my computer. It performs simulations of proteins and other molecules changing shape in the body, because if things go wrong there then horrible diseases like Alzheimer’s, cancer, or Parkinson’s may occur. It doesn’t even interfere with my regular computer usage, and its nice knowing that I can power state-of-the-art research without having to spend any money. Scientists have produced more than 95 scientific papers as a result of Folding@home with much of the promising results open to the public, and it is arguably the most powerful computing system on the planet today. I’ve led the “USU Aggies” team high into the rankings, and overall we’ve contributed an astonishing amount of computing to the project. I really feel that our contributions have significantly helped Folding@home, and I know they are being put to good use.
						
						As my interest in the project grew, so did the level of my involvement. Starting from a pretty dismal state, I wrote nearly the entirety of the 6,900-word Folding@home article on Wikipedia and achieved its Good Article status in April 2012, which meant that other editors recognized it as pretty encyclopedic and well-written, although further tweaks could still be made before it could be considered top-notch. The article is read between 400 and 500 times per day. I’m active on the Folding@home support forum, and my feedback has even been quoted by the director of the project, Dr. Pande from Stanford University, in one of his blog posts. When a scientists begins studying an interesting protein, I’m one of several dozen volunteers who test the stability of newly-minted simulation units when they are first released outside of the research lab. Aside from actually working at Stanford itself, I consider this to be as close to the front lines of disease research as I could get. I’ve also been granted permission to edit the FAQ pages of the project’s official website, which is typically exclusively edited by mods, admins, and research scientists.
						
						Alzheimer’s, cancer, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, Huntington's disease, and viral infection have killed millions in the past. Cancer in particular can devastate and kill a young child before they’ve had a chance to fully enjoy life. I know of no other project where anyone can help power state-of-the-art research towards the root causes of these diseases without donating any money, while being kept up-to-date of where the efforts are going and the progress the project is making towards cures.
